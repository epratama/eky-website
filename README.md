# Portfolio Website

Single-page neo-brutalist portfolio website. Fully automated deployment — one
command builds, provisions infrastructure, uploads, and configures DNS.
62 tests across 4 suites. 14 AWS resources managed via CloudFormation.
 Built through structured AI-driven development — [design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2025-07-09-resume-website-design.md) → [implementation plan](docs/superpowers/plans/2025-07-09-resume-website.md) → TDD → parallel subagent execution → verification gates — using **OpenCode** with the **Superpowers** skill system (see [Skills & Tools Used](#skills--tools-used)).

### Defense-in-depth

| Layer | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| **Bot protection** | hCaptcha (invisible, server-side verification) |
| **Origin restriction** | Lambda rejects requests from unknown domains (403) |
| **Rate limiting** | 3 requests/minute/IP — sliding window (429) |
| **CORS** | Restricted to domain (not `*`) |
| **Concurrency** | Lambda reserved concurrency: 5 |
| **SPF** | `v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com include:amazonses.com ~all` |
| **DKIM** | 3 signing keys via Amazon SES |
| **DMARC** | `p=none` — monitoring mode (reports to admin email) |

---

## Methodology

Built with **OpenCode** (AI coding agent) using the **Superpowers** skill system.

### Production Engineering

Moving beyond simple scripting to automated multi-step deployment with
mock-testable components and infrastructure-as-code:

- **CloudFormation** provisions 14 AWS resources in a single `deploy` command
- **`deploy.sh`** handles SES domain setup, certificate auto-detection,
  Route53 DNS, frontend build, S3 upload, and CloudFront invalidation
- **Idempotent operations** — skips already-configured resources (SES domain,
  Route53 records, cert)
- **30 shell unit tests** using mocked AWS CLI verify every code path

### Agent Architecture

Every interaction with OpenCode follows a **reAct (Reasoning + Acting)** loop: observe (read files, run commands) → reason (analyze, decide next step) → act (edit code, run checks). This cycle repeats continuously — every bug fix, test run, and deploy is a reAct turn.

For larger work, **hierarchical delegation** layers on top: the main agent decomposes a plan into independent tasks and dispatches **sub-agents**, each running their own reAct loop in parallel with their own context and tools. Sub-agents report back; the main agent integrates results, runs verification, and advances the plan. The 20-task implementation was executed this way via `subagent-driven-development`.

### Service Topology

Designed secure connections between AWS services:

- Route53 → CloudFront: ALIAS A records with ACM certificate (us-east-1)
- CloudFront → S3: Origin Access Control (OAC) with bucket policy
- API Gateway → Lambda: AWS_PROXY integration, payload format 2.0
- Lambda → SES: custom domain sender with full SPF/DKIM/DMARC alignment
- SES domain verification, MAIL FROM MX, DKIM CNAMEs — all automated in deploy script

### Architectural Governance

Structured how the AI agent authenticates to and provisions customer cloud infrastructure:

- **AWS CLI as the control plane**: All infrastructure operations executed through authenticated AWS CLI commands via OpenCode's shell tool — no intermediate UI, direct API access.
- **OAuth-based authentication**: IAM user credentials or SSO tokens managed through `aws configure` / `aws sso login`. The agent never stores or handles secrets — they live in the host machine's credential chain.
- **CloudFormation as the deployment contract**: Infrastructure defined declaratively in templates; the agent invokes `cloudformation deploy` as a single atomic operation rather than orchestrating individual create/update calls.
- **`deploy.sh` as the automation boundary**: All multi-step workflows (SES setup, cert detection, DNS config) encapsulated in a versioned, mock-testable shell script — the agent invokes the script rather than composing raw CLI calls.

### Product Feedback Loop

Identified technical friction points during development and built automated guardrails into `deploy.sh`, closing the loop in-project rather than filing external feature requests:

| Friction | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `AWS::Lambda::Url` blocked by org policy | Switched to API Gateway HTTP API |
| DMARC rejection when sending from external domain via SES | Custom SES domain sender with SPF/DKIM alignment |
| SES sandbox: emails silently fail if sender not verified | Automated `verify-email-identity` + polling loop in deploy script |
| JMESPath bracket notation fails on `@` character | Switched to escaped dot notation |
| CloudFront managed policy IDs differ by region | Replaced with inline `AWS::CloudFront::CachePolicy` resources |

through implementation plan to tested, deployed code. These artifacts show the
process behind the product:

| Artifact | Description |
|---|---|

## Deploy

Single command deploys everything:

```bash
./deploy.sh <stack-name>
```

### Full Pipeline

| Phase | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Pre-flight** | Checks `aws`, `jq`, `npm` installed. Queries CloudFormation for existing stack config. |
| **Interactive prompts** | Sender/recipient emails (prefilled from stack if exists), hCaptcha secret (hidden input). |
| **SES email verification** | Checks if sender + recipient are verified in SES. If not: sends verification email, polls every 5s (up to 2.5 min) until confirmed. Declining aborts deploy. |
| **ACM certificate** | Auto-searches for existing ISSUED cert in us-east-1. If found: reuses. If PENDING: shows DNS records and exits. If none: offers to request new, shows validation CNAMEs. |
| **CloudFormation deploy** | Builds parameter overrides, runs `cloudformation deploy`. After deploy: verifies DomainName + CertificateArn were applied, warns if not. |
| **Build + upload** | Runs `vite build` with API Gateway URL + hCaptcha site key. Syncs `dist/` to S3 with `--delete`. Creates CloudFront invalidation. |
| **Route53 DNS** | If custom domain configured: finds hosted zone, auto-creates ALIAS A records (root + www) pointing to CloudFront. Skips if already correct. |

All operations are idempotent — running twice produces the same result.

### SES Domain Setup

When the sender email uses a custom domain (not gmail.com etc.) and the domain
is on Route53, `deploy.sh` automatically configures email authentication:

| Step | Record | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain verification** | `_amazonses.domain.com` TXT | Proves you own the domain to SES |
| **SPF (sender auth)** | `domain.com` TXT (`v=spf1 include:amazonses.com`) | Receiving servers know SES is allowed. Merges with existing Google Workspace SPF if present. Preserves non-SPF TXT records. |
| **DKIM (signing)** | `*._domainkey.domain.com` CNAME × 3 | Cryptographically signs every email — prevents tampering and improves trust score |
| **MAIL FROM (envelope)** | `mail.domain.com` MX + SPF TXT | Custom bounce/return-path domain so SPF aligns with the `From` header |
| **DMARC (policy)** | `_dmarc.domain.com` TXT (`p=none`) | Tells receivers: "if SPF or DKIM fail, still deliver but send me reports." Monitors abuse before upgrading to `p=reject`. |

Without these: emails land in spam (or are rejected). With all five: full
SPF + DKIM + DMARC alignment → inbox delivery.

All operations are idempotent — running `deploy.sh` again skips anything
already configured.
